## Package Title 

`{knitr}`

## Vignettes 

`knitr` has a collection of vignettes covering topics, such as an introduction to the package, custom print methods, and `knit_expand()` to name a few. 

## Applications 

The package `knitr` has a [website](https://yihui.org/knitr/), where many examples of `knitr` in use is included under the "Examples" tab. Not only is there a list of examples included on the site page, but there is also a link to a Github repository that holds an even larger collection of knitr examples and a link to applications curated by other users. 

## Review 
According to the creators, the `knitr` was created to generate dynamic reports with R, wherein the user has full access to the input and output components. Additionally, `knitr` tackles "some long-standing problems in Sweave and combines features in other add-on packages into one package." I was **super** impressed with the package's ability to incorporate the formating of various academic journals, on top of the creation of other documents like class materials and CVs. If this wasn't enough, I really liked the ability and ease of including chunks of code and equations within documents. I, an R novice in many respects, found the package  easy enough to learn and would deem it user-friendly. I did run into some snags along the way (to be expected), though I cannot pinpoint if those sangs resulted from an issue with the package, an issue within R, or my beginning stages R skills. All in all, I have no major problems to report. Though I've only taking my first steps into the exploration the `knitr` package, I am already stunned by its utility, especially when paired with the `knitcitations` package. I would have never considered writing documents in R Markdown prior to this class, but have already recommended doing so to others in my lab!
